##Notes

I am using devise in this application. Few things to note in this:

* There are two models in this application a user model and an authorizations model and a user has_many authorizations.
* User can link to multiple social account from edit profile
* Once social accounts are linked, user can login from any connected social network.
* If user tries to create an account with a different social network while in loggedout stat. System maps it to the same account if that email address exists in the database else it will create a new account.
* Twitter don't provide email address of the user, nothing I can do about it.
* There are lot of other commented out gems in the Gemfile. Those are the gems that I use a lot in my various projects. I will strongly suggest you to checkout those gems.
